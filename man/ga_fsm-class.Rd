\arguments{
\item{x}{S4 ga_fsm object.
@export}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to/from other methods.}

\item{object}{S4 ga_fsm object}

\item{digits}{Optional numeric vector length one for how many significant digits to
print, default is 3.

 @export}

\item{y}{not used.}

\item{maintitle}{optional character vector}

\item{action_label}{optional character vector same length as action vector,
where each ith element corresponds to what that ith element in the action
vector represents. This will be used to fill in the states (circles) of the
state transition matrix to be plotted.}

\item{transition_label}{optional character vector same length as number of
columns of state transition matrix.}

\item{curvature}{optional numeric vector specifying the curvature of the
lines for a diagram of 2 or more states.}

\item{height}{ga_fsm S4 object}

\item{labels}{vector of labels for each point. For vectors the default is to
use names(x) and for matrices the row labels dimnames(x)[[1]].}

\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} that has columns named "period" and "outcome"
(period is the time period that the outcome action was taken), and one to
three additional columns, containing predictors.
All of the 3-5 columns should be named.
The period and outcome columns should be integer vectors and the columns
with the predictor variable data should be logical vectors
(\code{TRUE, FALSE}).
If the predictor variable data is not  logical, it will coerced to logical
with \cr
\code{base::as.logical()}.}

\item{type}{Not currently used.}

\item{na.action}{Optional function.}
