This document applies the `datafsm` software package [@nay2015] to the data from @fudenberg2012. 
For the motivation, underlying design, and tests on simulated data see @nay2015. 
For a simple example of how to use the package see the "[Introduction to datafsm](datafsm_introduction.html)" vignette.
```{r initialize}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
library(datafsm)

set.seed(1533406114)
```
Estimating a model is as simple as ensuring the input data, e.g. `prepped`, is 
in the correct format and calling `evolve_model(prepped)`. Here, we loop 
through the six experimental treatments in the data and estimate a separate 
model for each, storing the results in a list we name `res`. The `parallel` 
argument allows this work to automatically be spread across all available 
processors on the computer. This parallelization, combined with the 
implementation of the core computation in C++, speeds up estimation 
considerably.
```{r analyze_data}
data(FRD_games, package = "datafsm")

prepped <- data_frame(
  outcome = as.integer(
    ifelse(FRD_games$my.decision == "coop", 1, 2)
  ),
  period = as.integer(FRD_games$period),
  my.decision1 = as.integer(
    ifelse(FRD_games$my.decision1 == 1, 1, 0)
  ),
  other.decision1 = as.integer(
    ifelse(FRD_games$other.decision1 == 1, 1, 0)
  )
)

group_indices <- FRD_games$group %>% unique() %>% sort()
group_seeds <- sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, length(group_indices)) %>%
  set_names(as.character(group_indices))

patterns <- FRD_games %>% select(group, error, r, t) %>%
  group_by(group) %>% distinct() %>% ungroup() %>%
  arrange(group) %>% column_to_rownames(var = "group")

row.names(patterns) <- patterns$group

res <- lapply(as.list(group_indices), function(x){ 
  evolve_model(prepped[FRD_games$group==x,], parallel = TRUE, 
               seed = group_seeds[[as.character(x)]])
})
```
The resulting object has methods for inspecting (`print`, `show`, `summary`, 
`estimation_details`, `best_performance`, `varImp`, `states`), 
visualizing (`plot`, `barplot`, `dotchart`), and 
predicting new data (`predict`). 
Below we use the plot and barplot methods to see the resulting model and the 
associated relative importance of the predictor variables. In this case, the 
predictor variables are the outcomes of the decisions in the previous period of 
the game and the outcome variable (the current state) is the action the model 
predicts the agent will take in the current period. The state on the far left 
is the starting state.

The variable importance is computed by switching each value of an estimated 
modelâ€™s state matrix to another value in its feasible range, measuring the 
decrease in goodness of fit to the data, normalizing the values so the largest 
is 100, then summing across each column to estimate the relative importance of 
each predictor variable across all states.

```{r plot_results}
names(res) <- group_indices
tl = c("dd", "cd", "dc", "cc")
for(name in names(res)){
  plot(res[[name]], 
       action_label = ifelse(action_vec(res[[name]])==1, "C", "D"), 
       transition_label = tl,
       maintitle = paste0("Error: ", patterns[name, "error"], 
                          ", Reward: ", patterns[name, "r"],
                          ", Temptation: ", patterns[name, "t"],
                          "\n In-sample accuracy (n= ", 
                          formatC(sum(FRD_games$group==name),
                                  big.mark=',',digits=0),") : ",
                          round(best_performance(res[[name]]),2)))

   barplot(res[[name]], names.arg=tl)
}
```
These variable importance plots of the six models capture ways in which the 
game design affects player behavior. The first two models are from the games 
where the error is zero or low: the `cc` outcome is by far the strongest 
predictor of play. Compare this to the next four models where error is higher: 
the `dd` becomes much more important. Now compare the third and fourth models 
from games with payoffs more amenable to cooperation to the fifth and sixth 
models from games with payoffs less amenable to cooperation: the `dd` outcome 
is more important in the latter. We can summarize this main pattern with a 
table.

```{r model_comparison}
c_minus_d <- sapply(res, function(x) varImp(x)[4] - varImp(x)[1])
df <- cbind(patterns[group_indices, 
                     which(names(patterns) %in%  c("error", "r", "t"))], 
            c_minus_d)
names(df) <- c("Error", "Reward", "Temptation", "CC Imp. Rel. to DD")
row.names(df) <- NULL
pander(df)
```

These were all two-state models, which is the default. When we call 
`evolve_model` we can either manually set the number of states, states, or we 
can set the argument `cv` to `TRUE`, which then estimates the out-of-sample 
performance through _k_-fold cross-validation on the training data for many 
values of the number of states to determine the number of states with best 
out-of-sample performance for the given dataset (and the given split into 
_k_-folds, which it should be relatively insensitive to).

```{r k_fold}
k_fold_seeds <- sample.int(.Machine$integer.max, length(group_indices)) %>%
  set_names(as.character(group_indices))
res2 <- lapply(as.list(group_indices), function(x){ 
  evolve_model(prepped[FRD_games$group==x,], parallel = TRUE, 
               cv = TRUE, max_states = 6, k = 5, 
               seed = k_fold_seeds[[as.character(x)]])
})
```
```{r k_fold_results}
names(res2) <- group_indices
res2states <- sapply(res2, states)
df <- cbind(patterns[names(res2states), 
                     which(names(patterns) %in% 
                             c("error", "r", "t"))], res2states)
names(df) <- c("Error", "Reward", "Temptation", "States") 
row.names(df) <- NULL
pander(df)
```
