#'Use a Genetic Algorithm to Estimate a Finite-state Machine Model
#'
#'\code{evolve_model} uses a genetic algorithm to estimate a finite-state 
#'machine model, primarily for understanding and predicting decision-making.
#'
#'This is the main function of the \strong{datafsm} package. It relies on the 
#'\strong{GA} package for genetic algorithm optimization. \code{evolve_model} 
#'takes data on predictors and data on the outcome. It automatically creates a 
#'fitness function that takes the data, an action vector \code{evolve_model} 
#'generates, and a state matrix \code{evolve_model} generates as input and 
#'returns numeric vector of the same length as the \code{outcome}. 
#'\code{evolve_model} then computes a fitness score for that potential solution 
#'FSM by comparing it to the provided \code{outcome}. This is repeated for every
#'FSM in the population and then the probability of selection for the next 
#'generation is proportional to the fitness scores. The default is also for the 
#'function to call itself recursively while varying the number of states inside 
#'a cross-validation loop in order to estimate the optimal number of states.
#'
#'If parallel is set to TRUE, then these evaluations are distributed across the 
#'available processors of the computer using the \strong{doParallel} package, 
#'otherwise, the evaluations of fitness are conducted sequentially. Because 
#'this fitness function that \code{evolve_model} creates must loop through all 
#'the data every time it is evaluated and we need to evaluate many possible 
#'solution FSMs, the fitness function is implemented in C++ so it is very fast.
#'
#'\code{evolve_model} uses a stochastic meta-heuristic optimization routine to 
#'estimate the parameters that define a FSM model. Generalized simulated 
#'annealing, or tabu search could work, but they are more difficult to 
#'parallelize. The current version uses the \strong{GA} package's genetic 
#'algorithm because GAs perform well in rugged search spaces to solve integer 
#'optimization problems, are a natural complement to our binary string 
#'representation of FSMs, and are easily parallelized.
#'
#'This function evolves the models on training data and then, if a test set is 
#'provided, uses the best solution to make predictions on test data. Finally, 
#'the function returns the GA object and the decoded version of the best string 
#'in the population. See \linkS4class{ga_fsm} for the details of the slots 
#'(objects) that this type of object will have.
#'
#'@param data A \code{data.frame} that has columns named "period" and "outcome" 
#'  (period is the time period that the outcome action was taken), and one to
#'  three additional columns, containing predictors. 
#'  All of the 3-5 columns should be named. 
#'  The period and outcome columns should be integer vectors and the columns 
#'  with the predictor variable data should be logical vectors
#'  (\code{TRUE, FALSE}). 
#'  If the predictor variable data is not 
#'  logical, it will coerced to logical with
#'  \code{base::as.logical()}.
#'@param test_data Optional \code{data.frame} that has "period" and "outcome" 
#'  columns, with one to three additional columns containing predictors.
#'  All of the (3-5 columns) should be named. The outcome variable is the 
#'  decision the decision-maker took for that period. 
#'  This \code{data.frame} should be in the same format and have the same order 
#'  of columns as the data.frame passed to the required \code{data} argument.
#'@param drop_nzv Optional logical vector length one specifying whether 
#'  predictors variables with variance in provided data near zero should be 
#'  dropped before model building. Default is \code{FALSE}. See
#'  \code{caret::nearZeroVar()}, which calls:\cr
#'  \code{caret::nzv()}.
#'@param measure Optional length one character vector that is either:
#'  "accuracy", "sens", "spec", or "ppv". This specifies what measure of
#'  predictive performance to use for training and evaluating the model. The
#'  default measure is \code{"accuracy"}. However, accuracy can be a problematic
#'  measure when the classes are imbalanced in the samples, i.e. if a class the
#'  model is trying to predict is very rare. Alternatives to accuracy are
#'  available that illuminate different aspects of predictive power. Sensitivity
#'  answers the question, `` given that a result is truly an event, what is the
#'  probability that the model will predict an event?'' Specificity answers the
#'  question, ``given that a result is truly not an event, what is the
#'  probability that the model will predict a negative?'' Positive predictive
#'  value answers, ``what is the percent of predicted positives that are
#'  actually positive?''
#'@param states Optional numeric vector with the number of states. 
#'  If not provided, will be set to \code{max(data$outcome)}.
#'@param cv Optional logical vector length one for whether cross-validation 
#'  should be conducted on training data to select optimal number of states. 
#'  This can drastically increase computation time because if \code{TRUE}, it 
#'  will run \code{evolve_model} \code{k*max_states} times to estimate optimal value for 
#'  states. Ties are broken by choosing the smaller number of states. Default is
#'  \code{FALSE}.
#'@param max_states Optional numeric vector length one only relevant if 
#'  \code{cv==TRUE}. It specifies how up to how many states that 
#'  cross-validation should search through. 
#'  If not provided, will be set to \code{states + 1}.
#'@param k Optional numeric vector length one only relevant if cv==TRUE, 
#'  specifying number of folds for cross-validation.
#'@param actions Optional numeric vector with the number of actions. If not 
#'  provided, then actions will be set as the number of unique values in the 
#'  outcome vector.
#'@param seed Optional numeric vector length one.
#'@param popSize Optional numeric vector length one specifying the size of the 
#'  GA population. A larger number will increase the probability of finding a 
#'  very good solution but will also increase the computation time. This is 
#'  passed to the GA::ga() function of the \strong{GA} package.
#'@param pcrossover Optional numeric vector length one specifying probability of
#'  crossover for GA. This is passed to the GA::ga() function of the \strong{GA}
#'  package.
#'@param pmutation Optional numeric vector length one specifying probability of 
#'  mutation for GA. This is passed to the GA::ga() function of the \strong{GA} 
#'  package.
#'@param maxiter Optional numeric vector length one specifying max number of 
#'  iterations for stopping the GA evolution. A larger number will increase the 
#'  probability of finding a very good solution but will also increase the 
#'  computation time. This is passed to the GA::ga() function of the \strong{GA}
#'  package. \code{maxiter} is scaled by how many parameters are in the model:\cr
#'  \code{maxiter <- maxiter + ((maxiter*(nBits^2)) / maxiter)}.
#'@param run Optional numeric vector length one specifying max number of 
#'  consecutive iterations without improvement in best fitness score for 
#'  stopping the GA evolution. A larger number will increase the probability of 
#'  finding a very good solution but will also increase the computation time. 
#'  This is passed to the GA::ga() function of the \strong{GA} package.
#'@param parallel Optional logical vector length one. For running the GA 
#'  evolution in parallel. Depending on the number of cores registered and the 
#'memory on your machine, this can make the process much faster, but only works
#'for Unix-based machines that can fork the processes.
#'@param priors Optional numeric matrix of solutions strings to be included in 
#'  the initialization. User needs to use a decoder function to translate prior 
#'  decision models into bits and then provide them. If this is not specified, 
#'  then random priors are automatically created.
#'@param verbose Optional logical vector length one specifying whether helpful 
#'  messages should be displayed on the user's console or not.
#'@param return_best Optional logical vector length one specifying whether to 
#'  return just the best model or all models. Only relevant if ntimes > 1.
#'  Default is TRUE.
#'@param ntimes Optional integer vector length one specifying the number of 
#'  times to estimate model. Default is 1 time.
#'  
#'@return Returns an S4 object of class ga_fsm. See \linkS4class{ga_fsm} for the
#'  details of the slots (objects) that this type of object will have and for 
#'  information on the methods that can be used to summarize the calling and 
#'  execution of \code{evolve_model()}, including \code{summary}, \code{print},
#'  and \code{plot}. Timing measurement is in seconds.
